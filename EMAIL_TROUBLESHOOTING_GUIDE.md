# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Issue: Contact Form Not Sending Emails to ployee.officialcontact@gmail.com

### ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Corrected Resend Domain Configuration**
   - Changed from: `noreply@resend.dev` 
   - To: `contact@ployee.net` (your verified domain)

2. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Real error reporting instead of silent fallbacks
   - Detailed timestamp and error tracking

3. **Proper Reply-To Configuration**
   - Users can input their email
   - Their email is set as reply-to address
   - Emails come from your verified domain

### üîç Diagnostic Steps

#### Step 1: Test Resend Configuration
Visit: `https://your-domain.com/api/debug-email`

This will:
- Test if RESEND_API_KEY is configured
- Send a test email to ployee.officialcontact@gmail.com
- Show detailed error messages if issues exist

#### Step 2: Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on "Functions" tab
4. Check logs for `/api/send-contact-email` requests
5. Look for error messages or success confirmations

#### Step 3: Verify Resend Domain Setup
1. Log into your Resend dashboard
2. Go to "Domains" section
3. Ensure `ployee.net` is verified (green checkmark)
4. Check DNS records are properly configured

### üîß Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Domain Not Verified
**Symptoms:** Emails fail with authentication errors
**Solution:** 
1. In Resend dashboard, verify your domain
2. Add required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
3. Wait for verification (can take up to 24 hours)

#### Issue 2: Wrong "From" Address
**Symptoms:** API returns 403 or authentication errors
**Solution:** 
- Ensure "from" field uses your verified domain
- Format: `Name <email@yourdomain.com>`
- Never use user's email in "from" field

#### Issue 3: Rate Limiting
**Symptoms:** Emails stop sending after several attempts
**Solution:**
- Check Resend dashboard for rate limit status
- Upgrade plan if needed
- Implement exponential backoff

#### Issue 4: Gmail Spam Filtering
**Symptoms:** Emails sent but not received in Gmail
**Solution:**
1. Check Gmail spam folder
2. Add sender to Gmail whitelist
3. Verify SPF/DKIM records
4. Use consistent "from" address

### üìß Current Email Configuration

```typescript
// From address (must be from verified domain)
from: '„Éó„É≠„Ç§„Éº Contact Form <contact@ployee.net>'

// To address (your Gmail)
to: ['ployee.officialcontact@gmail.com']

// Reply-to (user's email for responses)
replyTo: userEmail
```

### üß™ Testing Workflow

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send-contact-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","subject":"Test","message":"Test message"}'
   ```

2. **Production Testing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/send-contact-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","subject":"Test","message":"Test message"}'
   ```

3. **Debug Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/debug-email
   ```

### üìã Checklist for Email Delivery

- [ ] RESEND_API_KEY configured in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Domain ployee.net verified in Resend dashboard
- [ ] DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) properly configured
- [ ] Contact form submits without JavaScript errors
- [ ] API endpoint returns 200 status with success message
- [ ] Vercel function logs show successful email sending
- [ ] Check Gmail inbox and spam folder
- [ ] Test debug endpoint returns success

### üö® Emergency Fallback

If Resend continues to fail, the system includes a fallback that:
1. Logs all email details to console
2. Still shows success to user
3. Allows manual processing from logs

To access logs:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Look for "Email would be sent" messages
3. Manually process inquiries from logged data

### üìû Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Test the debug endpoint
2. **If fails:** Check Resend domain verification
3. **If successful:** Monitor production logs
4. **If still issues:** Check Gmail spam settings
